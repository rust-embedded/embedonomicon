# All objdumps are compared to their expected output using the `-b` flag, which
# ignores whitespace changes within lines. This is good to avoid the necessity
# of regenerating blessed outputs each time `cargo objdump` makes minor
# formatting changes.
#
# Note that `diff -b` does _not_ allow whitespace changes to span multiple
# lines (i.e. the addition or removal of whitespace-only lines). This is a good
# thing, since some files are included in the book based on line number.
